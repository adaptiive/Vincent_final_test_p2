## Vincent Uy: here are the instructions for the final test repository


Steps I Followed:
1. Navigated to the folder where I wanted to clone the repo.
2. Ran the `git clone` command with the repository URL.
3. Verified the clone by checking the files and running `git status`.

What I Learned:
- I learned about creating a GitHub repository and set it up with a README, milestones, and issues. Adding files and linking them to issues helped me understand how version control organizes tasks. Cloning a public repo showed me how easy it is to work locally and sync changes back to GitHub. Overall, this class gave me hands-on experience with Git workflows and project management.
