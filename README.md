Vincent Uy: here are the instructions for the final test repository


Steps I Followed:
1. Navigated to the folder where I wanted to clone the repo.
2. Ran the `git clone` command with the repository URL.
3. Verified the clone by checking the files and running `git status`.

What I Learned:
- Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository, allowing me to work offline and sync changes later.
- It helped me understand how remote and local repositories interact in Git workflows.
